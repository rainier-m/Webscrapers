This is a series of Python scripts that I've compiled over time for various personal projects. I've used these various odd projects to teach myself Python. The most current of which is my concept that I call "dirty jobs". This takes a series of Restaurant Inspections from the state of Florida and works to parse them out to create some interesting content for my personal blog on where those restaurants are and what's going on in and around Florida.
